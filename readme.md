**There are many popular plugins already for this, why would I choose this one?**  
â€ƒâ€ƒâœ… Does not add bloatware    
â€ƒâ€ƒâœ… Does not spam you to upgrade to a paid version    
â€ƒâ€ƒâœ… Does not add unnecessary CSS or JavaScript    
â€ƒâ€ƒâœ… Non-commercial

This is just a plain plugin which tells WordPress to use *PHPMailer* and *SMTP* with the provided settings.

## Installation

Download the latest release, or when using composer use

```bash
composer require codeit-ninja/wordpress-smtp
```

## Usage

Activate the plugin and go to `Settings -> SMTP`, provide the necessary detail. Before you enable it make sure you first send a test email. If the test failed, make sure to resolve the problem first before enabling!

If you enable with a faulty config, none of your contact forms will work any longer.

If nothing wen't wrong and you successfully recieved the test email in your inbox you can check the 'Enable SMTP' checkbox.
